wafer.space was founded by Tim 'mithro' Ansell, a pioneer in open-source silicon and a dedicated advocate for accessible chip design. With extensive expertise spanning over two decades in open-source hardware and software, Tim has significantly influenced the development and adoption of open-source FPGA toolchains and Electronic Design Automation (EDA) software. He has been instrumental in various community-driven projects, including his influential roles in OpenROAD, FOSSi Foundation, and Google’s open-source initiatives such as SkyWater's open PDK and the Open MPW program.

Following the collapse of Efabless in 2025, Tim saw an urgent need to rebuild trust and expand opportunities within the silicon community. Leveraging his robust industry connections, experience in community management, and deep technical expertise, he established wafer.space with the mission to create a transparent, community-oriented silicon pooling service.

Under Tim’s leadership, wafer.space is committed to breaking down barriers to custom silicon fabrication, fostering collaboration, and driving forward the democratization of semiconductor technology, enabling engineers, startups, and researchers globally to innovate freely and efficiently.
