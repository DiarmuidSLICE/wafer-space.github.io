[wafer.space](https://wafer.space) was founded by **[Tim 'mithro' Ansell](https://mith.ro/)**, a pioneer in open-source silicon and a dedicated advocate for accessible chip design. With extensive expertise spanning over two decades in [open-source hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware) and software, Tim has significantly influenced the development and adoption of open-source FPGA toolchains and Electronic Design Automation ([EDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_design_automation)) software. He has played instrumental roles in various community-driven projects, including [OpenROAD](https://theopenroadproject.org/), the [FOSSi Foundation](https://fossi-foundation.org/), and Google's open-source initiatives such as [SkyWater's open PDK](https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk) and the [Open MPW program](https://developers.google.com/silicon).

Following the collapse of [Efabless](https://efabless.com) in 2025, Tim saw an urgent need to rebuild trust and expand opportunities within the silicon community. Leveraging his robust industry connections, community management experience, and deep technical expertise, he established wafer.space with the mission to create a transparent, community-oriented silicon pooling service.

Under Timâ€™s leadership, wafer.space is committed to breaking down barriers to custom silicon fabrication, fostering collaboration, and driving forward the democratization of semiconductor technology, enabling engineers, startups, and researchers globally to innovate freely and efficiently.
